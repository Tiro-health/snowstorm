## 🎯 What Changed Since Last Reports

### Between Build #58 (Previous) and Build #66 (Current)

**3 Tests Fixed** (50% reduction in failures):

1. ✅ **FHIRLoadPackageServiceTest.uploadPackageResources**
   - Fixed: Incorrect repository ID usage for CodeSystem and ValueSet
   - Root cause: Different resources use different ID strategies

2. ✅ **FHIRCodeSystemProviderInstancesTest.testCodeSystemRecovery**
   - Fixed: Resource leak from test cleanup
   - Root cause: Cascade effect from Fix #1

3. ✅ **FHIRCodeSystemProviderInstancesTest.testCodeSystemRecoverySorted**
   - Fixed: Same resource leak issue
   - Root cause: Cascade effect from Fix #1

**Key Achievement**: All infrastructure and test isolation issues are now resolved!
