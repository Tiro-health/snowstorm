# Phase 1 Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Implemented by**: Jaak (jaak.daemen@tiro.health)  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED AND PUSHED**

---

## What Was Done

### Problem Discovered
The originally reported "Phase 1" fix (removing `@TestConfiguration`) had already been attempted in commit `31484ea0`, but the tests were still failing. Investigation revealed a deeper issue: the `@PostConstruct` annotation on the `setupTestData()` method.

### Root Cause Analysis
The `@PostConstruct` annotation caused test data setup to run **during Spring bean initialization**, not after. This created a circular dependency problem:
1. Spring starts creating beans
2. Some bean needs `cacheManager`
3. Creating `cacheManager` requires initializing `ECLQueryServiceFilterTestConfig`
4. The `@PostConstruct` method tries to run heavy test setup (create branches, concepts, versions)
5. But Spring context isn't fully initialized yet
6. Services needed for test setup aren't ready
7. **CIRCULAR DEPENDENCY FAILURE**

### Solution Implemented

**Changed Files**:
1. `src/test/java/org/snomed/snowstorm/ecl/ECLQueryServiceFilterTestConfig.java`
   - ❌ Removed `@PostConstruct` annotation
   - ❌ Removed `import jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct`
   - ✅ Renamed `beforeAll()` to `setupTestData()` (more descriptive)

2. `src/test/java/org/snomed/snowstorm/ecl/ECLQueryServiceFilterTest.java`
   - ✅ Added `@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)`
   - ✅ Added `@BeforeAll void setupTestData()` method
   - ✅ Autowired `ECLQueryServiceFilterTestConfig testConfig`
   - ✅ Call `testConfig.setupTestData()` in @BeforeAll

**Why This Works**:
- `@BeforeAll` runs **after** Spring context is fully initialized
- All services are available when test data setup runs
- No circular dependencies
- Proper separation: bean creation → context initialization → test setup

## Expected Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ 13 errors in ECLQueryServiceFilterTest
- ❌ All tests in this class failing to initialize
- ❌ Circular dependency errors
- ❌ Success rate: 97.7% (820/839 passing)

### After Fix (Expected)
- ✅ 0 errors in ECLQueryServiceFilterTest  
- ✅ All 13 tests should run and pass
- ✅ No circular dependencies
- ✅ Success rate: 99.3% (833/839 passing)

**Remaining issues**: 6 FHIR test assertion failures (not related to this fix)

## Verification Steps

### Local Verification (if Maven available)
```bash
mvn test -Dtest=ECLQueryServiceFilterTest
```

### CI Verification
1. Go to https://github.com/Tiro-health/snowstorm/actions
2. Find the build for commit `c31db27c`
3. Wait for completion (~19 minutes)
4. Check test results

**Success Indicators**:
- ✅ ECLQueryServiceFilterTest: 13 tests passing
- ✅ Total: 833 passing (up from 820)
- ✅ Errors: 0 (down from 13)
- ✅ Failures: 6 (unchanged - different issue)

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Fix FHIR Test Assertions (~2 hours)
The 6 remaining test failures are FHIR assertion mismatches:
1. FHIRCodeSystemProviderInstancesTest (2 failures)
2. FHIRCodeSystemServiceTest (1 failure)
3. FHIRLoadPackageServiceTest (1 failure)
4. FHIRValueSetProviderExpandEclTest (1 failure)
5. FHIRValueSetProviderValidateCodeEclTest (2 failures)

See `CI_CD_INVESTIGATION_REPORT_2025-10-15.md` Section 2 for details.

### Phase 3: Optional JMS Cleanup (~30 minutes)
Clean up JMS shutdown warnings (cosmetic, non-blocking).

## Confidence Assessment

**Confidence in Phase 1 Fix**: **95%**

**Reasoning**:
1. Root cause clearly identified
2. Standard Spring testing pattern applied
3. Similar fixes work in other test classes
4. Logical separation of concerns
5. No dependencies on external factors

**Risk**: LOW - If it doesn't work, we can easily roll back or adjust
